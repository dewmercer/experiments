Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -7.829 ns between lowDuration_reg[9]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and counter_reg[13]/R (clocked by clk_8192KHz_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
